    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Some children who struggle with either or both areas of development are often unable to understand and express their emotions. The lack of language makes each emotion far less concrete -instead it becomes an unknown, nebulous feeling. These strong, unlabelled emotions can be very frightening and frustrating, causing emotional meltdowns and destructive behavior.
    </p>

      Targeted User: children with developmental disabilities<br />
      Secondary User: adults (in charge of assistance and settings)

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
    <p>
      The purpose of competitive analysis was to determine strength and weakness of our competitors. Based on the five criteria: vocabulary, easiness, interaction, education, and fun, I conducted a competitive analysis of Look At Me, an application developed by Samsung that aims to improve socialization skills for autistic children. The interactions between Look At Me and its users involve sound, illustrations, and camera, which effectively creates an engaging environment. The interface design of this application is cute and appropriate for children. However, it has some shortcomings that our group should notice. The language overall is clear and concise, but involves difficult vocabulary and the amount of text is too much for our targeted user. Its function is merely around encouraging the user to make more eye contact. Few practices designed for improving expressing ability. Also, the eye contact is different from looking into the camera, and it may be difficult for children with learning abilities to draw the connection between a camera lens and human eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conclusion: Considering the age and knowledge of our targeted users, our ideal product should be fun, intuitive, and contain as less vocabulary as possible.
    </p>
    <h4>Interview</h4>
    <p>
      The purpose of interview was to learn about how parents teach their children emotions. Due to limited resources, we were unable to directly interact with special needs children and their parents. We interviewed parents with normal young children instead. I had an interview with Georgina, a mother of an 18-month old boy. Some of my takeaways were further applied in the design:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#9679; Georgina often tells stories to her son. Whenever it involves emotions, she intentionally exaggerates her facial expressions.<br />&#9679; She uses simple words and repeats them a lot.<br />&#9679; She finds cards with cartoon characters are less effective in helping her son associate them with real life expressions.<br />&#9679; At about 6 to 8 months old, her son showed consciousness of emotions and started to form concepts. At 12 months old, he could recognize a few emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conclusion: 
      <br />&#9679; Provide contexts of emotions<br />&#9679; Repeat to enhance memories<br />&#9679; Use real life facial expressions

    <h3>Persona & Scenario</h3>
    <img src="templates/bridge/persona.png" width="60%" />
    <p>
      After witnessing Maggie become overwhelmed and have an emotional breakdown when another child begins crying, her mother downloads the app per the recommendation of her pediatrician. Over the course of a few months, however, she begins to associate different words with expressions and reactions, due to the pattern recognition the app attempts to instill.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, Maggie goes to the Kindering Center as usual. When she is playing with a train, we is trapped by a little boy. Maggie sits on the ground and begins to cry. A volunteer comes to her and tries to console her. This time, instead of being completely inconsolable, she says the word “sad,” then continues to cry.

    <h3>Prototype</h3>
    <p>
      We first decided to design an app for tablet so that it is easier to use in children centers and can be used as accessory educational tool, but since smartphones are more common among families and they are more portable, we finally decided to make a mobile app so that children can play with it outside institutions.

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      We created a mobile application <u id="mobile1"><strong><sub>(?)</sub></strong></u><span id="mobile">Mobile devices have less environmental constraints and their sizes are suitable for small hands.</span> to help 2-to-3-year old children <u id="age1"><strong><sub>(?)</sub></strong></u><span id="age">Between 2 and 3 years, children are making giant leaps in terms of labeling and understanding feelings.</span> who struggle in their social and emotional development learn to associate language and emotion. Under the assistance of adults, children learn to label emotions through the app’s interactive activities with high quality audio and visual feedback.
