    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Many children who are delayed in both social and language development are unable to clearly identify or express their emotions, causing tantrums or other more destructive outlets, which in turn results in more frustration on part of both children and caregivers. In order to counteract this problem, we are creating an app for tablets, phones, and laptops that would remove the motor stumbling blocks for the physically challenged users by replacing buttons with the preexisting touchscreen and provide clear audio and visual feedback to relate emotion and language, encouraging constructive expression. In addition, this app will be portable and convenient for both the children and the parents.

    <h3>Work Process</h3>
    <h4>Personas</h4>
    <p>
      Since the child need to interact with the product under the assistance with the parent, we create a child scenario and a parent scenario to show the perspective using the product.

    <h3>Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      The biggest challenge that I encountered is to have the latest post shown on the page right after the submission. Share used Google Datastore to store usersâ€™ posts, but it took longer for Datastore to update the newest entity than the page redirection. I made several attempts. For instance, I created a separate page for submission instead of using modal so that the home page would not automatically refresh. We could just update the view first or let the page wait for a little bit time before it refreshes, but we decided not to do that. One night, I was trying to set a time interval so that the posts could be synchronized on multiple screens without refreshing manually. Then I surprisingly realized that the datastore problem could be fixed when I set the time interval to have the ajax function called repeatedly, and I was so happy about it.

    <h3>What I would do if I had more time?</h3>
    <p>
      I enabled Facebook login, but I did not have enough time to work on it. Currently all it does is to have name filled on the form once the user is logged in. I would love spend some time to explore Facebook API, and improve the user experience with it.

    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
    <h4>Stay confident, but avoid underestimation.</h4>
    <p>
      It was hard to know how difficult the problem was until we started to solve it. Sometimes the problem was easier than we thought, sometimes we got stuck in an unexpected problem for a really long time. It is important to have a positive attitude, and take each problem seriously.

    <h4>Try to become the team member that myself would love to work with.</h4>
    <p>
      I was lucky to have a partner with great ideas and I feel proud of both of us because we did not avoid challenges due to its complexity. He was very supportive when I almost wanted to give up. I really enjoyed working with him, and it also made me think that the same time I expect to have a pleasant working experience, I should be a lovable teammate first.
