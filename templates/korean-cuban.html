    <h4>Step 3: Prototype</h4>
    <p>
      We spent the most time writing code. It was not easy to use what we had learned to accomplish what we wanted to build, but we decided to challenge ourselves.

    <h3>Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      The biggest challenge that I encountered is to have the latest post shown on the page right after the submission. Share used Google Datastore to store usersâ€™ posts, but it took longer for Datastore to update the newest entity than the page redirection. I made several attempts. For instance, I created a separate page for submission instead of using modal so that the home page would not automatically refresh. We could just update the view first or let the page wait for a little bit time before it refreshes, but we decided not to do that. One night, I was trying to set a time interval so that the posts could be synchronized on multiple screens without refreshing manually. Then I surprisingly realized that the datastore problem could be fixed when I set the time interval to have the ajax function called repeatedly, and I was so happy about it.

    <h3>What I would do if I had more time?</h3>
    <p>
      I enabled Facebook login, but I did not have enough time to work on it. Currently all it does is to have name filled on the form once the user is logged in. I would love spend some time to explore Facebook API, and improve the user experience with it.

    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
    <h4>Stay confident, but avoid underestimation.</h4>
    <p>
      It was hard to know how difficult the problem was until we started to solve it. Sometimes the problem was easier than we thought, sometimes we got stuck in an unexpected problem for a really long time. It is important to have a positive attitude, and take each problem seriously.

    <h4>Try to become the team member that myself would love to work with.</h4>
    <p>
      I was lucky to have a partner with great ideas and I feel proud of both of us because we did not avoid challenges due to its complexity. He was very supportive when I almost wanted to give up. I really enjoyed working with him, and it also made me think that the same time I expect to have a pleasant working experience, I should be a lovable teammate first.
