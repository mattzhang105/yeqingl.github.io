  <h3>Background</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-7">
      <p class="prj_text">
        In summer 2016, I had an internship as a UX designer at Autel Robotics, a start-up company selling its own drones. It has a parent company called Autel in China, whose designers and developers created the first generation of the Starlink mobile app. I worked with the other UX designer Jasmine to provide insights from the UX perspective and make the app more suitable to the US customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project was to redesign the app. Due to my limited time and the priority of different parts of the app, I focused mostly on iterating the app’s onboarding part, which is shown to the new users and teaches them how to set up their drones quickly and correctly. Before I joined, the first iteration of the onboarding part had been done by Jasmine and her teammates in the General Assembly. Therefore, my work started with the usability testing of their design.

  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <p class="prj_text">
        Setting up a drone is complicated, especially for people with no background. According to our research and observation, it normally takes more than 30 minutes to set up a new drone and get into the air. The amount of time is a minus to the overall user experience for a user who is really excited and wants to fly as soon as possible. Our goal was to find out what makes the setup so long and make it easier and less painful.

  <h3>Audience</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <p class="prj_text">
        Autel Robotics wants to bring drones into people’s daily and professional lives as a great tool for entertainment and work. The users are not only the professional drone pilots, but also the photographers, the hobbyists, the farmers, and the real estimate agencies -- people with various background.

  <h3>Constraints</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <p class="prj_text">
        The biggest constraint is the communication. Not being able to work side by side with other designers and the developers made the design process less efficient. We needed to work with a visual and interaction design team in China and a group of developers to produce the new generation of the app. We communicated through emails and had a weekly Skype meeting on every Tuesday. I was the only person who spoke mandarin and had design background, so besides working with Jasmine, I was in charge of the communication between the US and the China sides.

        Auto Pilot Sketches: Even if we worked mostly on the onboarding part, we always kept in mind that there were other parts of the app needed to be considered. The sketches on the left are my ideas of the app’s auto pilot feature. This smart feature allows the user to program the route of the drone, such as following, orbiting, and flying along waypoints.
