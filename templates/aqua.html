		<h3>Project Overview</h3>
		<p>
			Aqua is a music player that remembers, learns and visualizes users’ listening habits. I used Adobe Illustrator to design interfaces, and used AfterEffects to make animations.

		<h3>Work Process</h3>
		<h4>Step1: Identify Problem</h4>
		<p>			
			Weekly recommendation is a common function of many music players, but very often the music players fails to offer music that the user really want because it does not know the user very well. They figure out the recommendation lists by tracking users’ listening history, but the history reflects only what the user has listened to, which is not always equal to what they like, and if the user wants to try something new music, the history is unable to help at this time.
		</p>
		<h4>Step2: Brainstorm and Sketch</h4>
		<p>
			Since new users do not have any listening history, I designed a quiz after signup to help Aqua get information about users’ interested genres and types of music so that it can provide suitable recommendations. I was also thinking about visualizing users’ listening history, since it is helpful for them to know about their listening styles, too. The first idea I came up with was to create a planet for each user, and the components of the planet change as the user listen to more music. Then I realized it could not make noticeable changes, because the components were represented by color blocks. Therefore, I changed the planet into a tree, and used branches of tree to represent genres the user has listened to.
